## GSP Website

Notes

#### So far...

- NextJS + Sanity setup deployed
- Navigation setup with document data being fetched from Sanity
- Dropdown menu for each nav item with documents

#### To do....

- Look at options for dropdown styling on both mobile and desktop.
-- Mobile would be better with an accordion but I dunno about desktop.
- Pick some fonts
- Pick better colour scheme
- Design landing page
-- Do paper cutouts of each puppet
-- Float animation for these
-- Look into golden scissors animation
